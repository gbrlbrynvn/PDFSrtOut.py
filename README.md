<h1>Python Script: Sort and Output PDF using .csv file</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I worked with a client that required me to go through thousands of PDFs, containing personal and insurance information of thousands of their clients. I was given a separate excel file containing the names of their clients and my task was to collect and cut all the sections for each person and combine those sections into a separate PDF file. I made this Python script to automate everything and saving hours of manual work.
